# Reading List #

Inspired by [cory schires reading-list](https://github.com/coryschires/reading-list "coryschires's reading-list") (which was in itself inspired by Apprenticeship Patterns).

The goals of this list are:

* Keep an active list of hte books that I have read, partially read, and plan to read
* Write a brief description of what I got out of and learned from each book, both as a way to solidify my understanding and as a book review excerpt
* Provide a central point for any blog posts I write that further expand upon my thoughts related to each book
* Provide a publicy-available datastore for my notes related to some of the books I read

I will include anything going forward that fits the desired subjects, but may add something I've read previously if it's particularly on-point or if I found it invaluable.


## Books ##



####[Eloquent Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321584104 "Amazon: Eloquent Ruby") Russ Olsen####

> A brillaint resource for anyone who is new to Ruby (though I'd recommend that you're somewhat familiar with programming, and ideally have played around with Ruby at least a bit). Eloquent Ruby is not an exercises or project-based book, but rather a wonderfully detailed explanation of all the unique, programmer-friendly features that are core to being a strong Rubyist.

####[The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU "Amazon: The Power of Habit") Charles Duhigg####

> I greatly enjoyed reading this book. It felt all strangely familiar (I believe I'd read various excerpts, reviews, and perhaps even some coverage of the various stufies and anecdotes used by Duhigg), but great fun to read regardless. It's an easy read, though if you're crunched for time, the value decreases in the last two sections, with the last one being a bit off-point and out-of-place.
