# Reading List #

Inspired by [cory schires reading-list](https://github.com/coryschires/reading-list "coryschires's reading-list") (which was in itself inspired by Apprenticeship Patterns).

The goals of this list are:

* Keep an active list of hte books that I have read, partially read, and plan to read
* Write a brief description of what I got out of and learned from each book, both as a way to solidify my understanding and as a book review excerpt
* Provide a central point for any blog posts I write that further expand upon my thoughts related to each book
* Provide a publicy-available datastore for my notes related to some of the books I read

I will include anything going forward that fits the desired subjects, but may add something I've read previously if it's particularly on-point or if I found it invaluable.

> A brillaint resource for anyone who is new to Ruby (though I'd recommend that you're somewhat familiar with programming, and ideally have played around with Ruby at least a bit). Eloquent Ruby is not an exercises or project-based book, but rather a wonderfully detailed explanation of all the unique, programmer-friendly features that are core to being a strong Rubyist.
